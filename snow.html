      <h1> CHAPTER ONE HTML5 BASIC TAGS</h1> 
      <p> HTML5 is the latest version of the webâ€™s core language, 
        designed to improve structure, performance, and accessibility.
        It introduces native support for multimedia, reducing reliance 
        on third-party plugins. New semantic elements like header,
        title, and section make web pages more readable and easier to navigate.

                HTML5 enhances interactivity through features like the
                canvas element and scalable vector graphics. It also 
                improves web application performance with local storage,
                reducing server requests and enabling offline capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Mobile and Speed Optimization
        HTML5 optimizes mobile web experiences by supporting 
        responsive design, ensuring compatibility across devices.
        It enhances speed with asynchronous script loading, better
        caching, and improved rendering, making modern web 
        applications more efficient and user-friendly</p>
